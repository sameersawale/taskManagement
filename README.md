This is the task management application using spring boot and mysql.
In this project I used jwt authentication and swagger ui.
For open above application use "localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html" url
for register new user click on "user/register"
for login click on "user/login" and add token to authorize.
You can add task respective current login user and see task list of this user
